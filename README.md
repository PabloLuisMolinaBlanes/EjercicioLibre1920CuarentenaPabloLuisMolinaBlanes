# CRISPR Generator and Strand analyzer.
This program can save a CRISPR strand you place in your program, and analyze strands provided using the CRISPR strand as a search pattern to find within. CRISPR, is a strand, used by bacteria, to defend itself from attacks by other micro-organisms, when they detect a similar strand, its defense mechanisms setting out to destroy it and stop whatever infection. This program does just that.
